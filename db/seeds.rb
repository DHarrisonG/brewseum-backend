    It was hand carved in Spain nearly 200 years ago, shipped to California during the Gold rush, 
    and somehow ended up in Okarche in 1950. It's one of the few surviving items from a fire that 
    destroyed the original Eischen’s in 1993.",

    away a free turkey sandwich with every drink. In fact, it was the famous turkey that kept 
    the place alive during Prohibition. While the free deal sadly no longer exists, the 
    sandwich is still worth the stop.",
